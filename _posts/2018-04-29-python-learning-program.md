# NOTE: this is a work-in-progress, not recommended for reading yet

This article aims to help those, who want to learn how to program, to get started without being distracted by large number of options available. I believe that [Python](https://www.python.org/) is the best choice currently for learning to program, because Python is both *easy and useful*. 

## Installing
For learning Python I recommend [Thonny](http://thonny.org/), which is an open-source Python code editor orientated towards begineers that incorporates Python itself, so you only need to install Thonny to get started. I recommend using Thonny instead of the built-in [IDLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDLE) code editor, which is obsolecent, ["disposable"](http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2011/11/29/the-things-i-hate-about-idle-that-i-wish-someone-would-fix/) and unsuitable for begineers, in my opinion.

## Learning
There are many Python learning resources available on the web. Too many in fact, with so many options there is great potential for confusing and wasting time, if you don't know where to start. 

I recommend starting with [Think Python 2nd ed.](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) by *Allen B. Downey*, which is [free-to-read](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/index.html) online, or you can [buy the book](http://amzn.to/1WmXPCx) if you prefer.

The next learning resource I recommend is the book [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart.  It is also [free-to-read online](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc) or you can [buy the book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593275994/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1593275994&linkCode=as2&tag=playwithpyth-20&linkId=HDM7V3T6RHC5VVN4). *Automate-the-Boring-Stuff* focuses on the *useful* aspect of Python, while still being very accessible to beginners.

You should also become familiar with the official [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/), it is well developed and comprehensive, if necessarily not very accessible for begineers. You should start with the official [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html), that's were I started to learn Python myself, around 15 years ago(!) The [Glossary](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html) is also useful, to cope with terminology confusion. 

As you learn more, you will need to become familiar with the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html), this contains many of the built-in tools that make Python so useful. The Python [Module of the Week](https://pymotw.com/3/) series of articles are very helpful for understanding how to use the standard library. The Python documentation also contains some useful [how-to](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/index.html) articles that help explain some Python details. I find the [regex how-to](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html) particularly useful (if you don't know what a ["regex"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) is, don't worry, you will learn about these very [useful and tricky](http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/247) tools soon...) 

## Other useful resources

[PyVideo](http://pyvideo.org/) is a respository of presentations at various Python conferences around the world. [Browsing the videos](http://pyvideo.org/events.html) should give you some idea of the many interesting things people are doing with Python. There are also many [video tutorials](http://pyvideo.org/tag/tutorial/) available.

## And now for something completely different...
