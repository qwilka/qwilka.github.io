**NOTE: this is a work-in-progress, not recommended for reading yet**

This article aims to help those, who want to learn how to program, to get started without being distracted by large number of options available. I believe that Python is the best choice currently for beginner programming, because it is both *easy and useful*. 

# Installing
To learn Python, I recommend [Thonny](http://thonny.org/), which is an open-source Python code editor orientated towards begineers that incorporates Python itself, so you only need to install Thonny to get started. 

# Learning
There are many Python learning resources available on the web. Too many in fact, with so many options there is great potential for confusing and wasting time, if you don't know where to start. 

I recommend starting with [Think Python 2nd ed.](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) by *Allen B. Downey*, which is [free-to-read](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/index.html) online, or you can [buy the book](http://amzn.to/1WmXPCx) if you prefer.

The next learning resource I recommend is the book [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart.  It is also [free-to-read online](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc) or you can [buy the book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593275994/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1593275994&linkCode=as2&tag=playwithpyth-20&linkId=HDM7V3T6RHC5VVN4). *Automate-the-Boring-Stuff* focuses on the *useful* aspect of Python, while still being very accessible to beginners.

You should also become familiar with the official [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/), it is well developed and comprehensive, if necessarily not very accessible for begineers. You should start with the official [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html), that's were I started to learn Python myself, around 15 years ago(!) The [Glossary](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html) is also useful, to cope with terminology confusion. 

## And now for something completely different...
