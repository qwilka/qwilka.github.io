I have just set up a demonstration web [GIS](https://qwilka.github.io/GIS/) (geographical information system) for my subsea data company Qwilka. It is built using the open source web mapping library [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/), which is lightweight and easy to program. The plan is to use the [GIS](https://qwilka.github.io/GIS/) to display open data related to the subsea oil & gas industry. The base map is taken from [GEBCO](https://www.gebco.net/) which provides a global map with ocean bathymetry. This is also an alternative base map from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) with more land based details like borders, roads and cities.

To start with, the [Subsea GIS](https://qwilka.github.io/GIS/) will display data provided by [WMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service) (web map service) providers, because that's the easiest to set up, it merely involves passing on data that has been prepared by the WMS provider. Presently there is subsea infrastructure data from the [NPD](http://www.npd.no/en/About-us/Available-data/) (Norwegian Petroleum Directorate) and the [Irish Government](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/offshore-gas-pipeline). I will be adding more open subsea data in due course, as I identify suitable providers.
