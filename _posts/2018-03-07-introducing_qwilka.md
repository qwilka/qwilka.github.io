title: "Introducing Qwilka"

By way of introducing Qwilka, the startup company I founded to develop new ways of managing engineering data and get more value from it, I present this short video. I made the video as part of Qwilka's application to the [OGTC](https://theogtc.com/) TechX Pioneer accelerator programme in Aberdeen.  The video did its job, not notwithstanding the basic production, in that Qwilka was invited to pitch to the OGTC in Aberdeen (on the date of this post, as it happened.) Apparently there were more than 120 applications, and only 16 were invited to pitch, but unfortunately Qwilka was not among the 10 companies chosen to participate in the 2018 Pioneer programme following the pitch session.  I am not too disappointed, given the high quality of the [selected companies](http://www.theogtc.com/media-centre/news/2018/techx-accelerator-announces-first-pioneers/), and since it was an achievement for Qwilka to be invited to pitch. I know there will be other opportunities to develop Qwilka in the future, and we will definitely be pursuing some of those.
