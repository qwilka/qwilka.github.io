_work-in-progress_ NOT READY TO ISSUE YET

## Why another introduction to Python programming?

This article is written for engineers, civil, mechanical or similar, who wish to become
proficent in computer programming, but who are starting from a low base.  It particularly concerns more experienced engineers who have become accostomed to directing the work of others, while still keeping up with technical development in their own field, but who have been observing the encroachment of newer computer and data technologies into their field, and are no longer happy to completely delegate these newer developments to others. Some of these hypothetical engineers may have 
programmed a bit in the past, perhaps in Matlab at university, or they may have written some macros for Excel in VBA to automate some design calculations earlier in their career.  

Entering the terms _learn python_ into Google yields _about 3,470,000 results_.  Although I cannot confirm this claim, the first two pages of search results offer plenty of interesting options. 
[http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/intro/learning/](Learning Python â€” The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python) attracts my attention. This webpage turns out to be another long list of 
websites offering tutorials and introductions to Python programming. I am familar with some
of these, and I know that they will help the type of learner I have in mind. Others that I recognise would be less helpful, in my opinion. But most of the websites listed
on the _The Hitchhiker's Guide_ are unfamiliar to me, and like my hypothetical learner I do not have time to explore them all.
